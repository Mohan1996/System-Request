# System Request

This repository contains 3 documents.
The first document is the "Artisan's System Request", which is a system request asked by Artisan's Coop North for a new software application that will improve work efficiency.
The System Proposoal is my solution on what the new system should be built as. It identifies the problems with the current system, offers solutions, and gives reasoning on why the solutions will improve the system.
The System Specification identifies hardware and software requirements to the new system, as well as how to maintain it and what threats exist to the system.
